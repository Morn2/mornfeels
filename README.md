# Mornfeels

Mornfeels is an MVP project designed to help users log and analyze their moods. The project starts with a simple CSV-based logging system that uses built-in reminders to prompt mood entries. An existing Python script is used for data analysis and visualization. In the future, Mornfeels will evolve into a full Android application using Kivy with an enhanced user interface and additional features.

## Project Overview

- **Logging:** The app reminds you to record your mood at regular intervals.
- **Data Management:** Mood entries are stored in a CSV file.
- **Analysis:** A Python script processes and visualizes your mood data.
- **Future Development:** Plans include transitioning to an Android app using Kivy and adding features like data export and improved visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) for data analysis

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mornfeels.git

   ```
3. Install required packages:

### Usage

- **Data Analysis:** To run the analysis and visualization script, execute:
